Premmerce Permalink Manager for WooCommerce allows you to change WooCommerce permalink and remove product and product_category slugs from the URL.

== Description ==

Premmerce Permalink Manager for WooCommerce is developed to shortener the current WooCommerce URL and make it more SEO-friendly. 
According to several industry studies, we acknowledge at least two purposes to utilize Permalink Manager for eCommerce:
* **URL Length.** According to [Ahrefs research](https://ahrefs.com/blog/on-page-seo/), there is a clear correlation between the number of characters in a URL and rankings.
* **URL Path.** Another well-known fact in the industry is that the closer the page located to the homepage, the more authority boost it may get vs. pages hidden deep down in a siteâ€™s architecture. You can read more on top ranking factors on the [Backlinko article](https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors).
